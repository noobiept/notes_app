Clicking on the window's 'X' button hides the window (instead of closing it).

Double-click on the system tray icon to show/hide the application.

To close the application, you need to right click on the system tray icon, and click on the 'close' button.

To have the application start on windows startup, just add a shortcut to the 'Startup' folder (start -> all programs -> find 'Startup' folder).
